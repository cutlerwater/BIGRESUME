    "bio": "Hi there! I am Garrett! You might also know me as Cutlerwater. I've been coding for quite some time now but I've really been trying to ramp it up and push the envelope as far as I can. As an IT consultant I've worked both with startups and large organizations/departments to help build & scale their data centers. Along the journey I realized my passion with development. I would love to share my progress, final projects and my knowledge with anyone out there that wants it.",
